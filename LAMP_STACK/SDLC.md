### SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE
The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure. 

Managing software development can be complex given evolving requirements, technological advancements, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology furnishes a structured management framework, defining distinct deliverables at each phase of development. This ensures that all stakeholders align on development objectives and requirements from the outset, with a clear roadmap to achieve these goals.  
Advantages of employing SDLC:
* Enhanced transparency of the development process for all involved stakeholders
* Streamlined estimation, planning, and scheduling processes
* Enhanced risk mitigation and accurate cost forecasting
* Methodical software delivery, leading to heightened customer satisfaction

##### The SDLC process

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) encompasses various tasks essential for constructing a software application. As developers iteratively add features and address issues, the development process advances through multiple stages.

###### Planning:
During this phase, tasks such as cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation are undertaken. The development team collaborates with stakeholders—customers, internal and external experts, and managers—to formulate a software requirement specification document. This document establishes expectations, delineates common goals, and informs project planning. The team estimates costs, devises a schedule, and formulates a comprehensive plan to achieve their objectives.

###### Design:
In the design phase, software engineers scrutinize requirements and discern optimal solutions for software creation. They may consider integrating pre-existing modules, make technology choices, and select development tools. Additionally, they explore strategies for seamlessly integrating the new software into the organization's existing IT infrastructure.

###### Implementation:
During the implementation phase, the development team translates plans into action by writing code. They break down requirements into smaller coding tasks, executing them incrementally to realize the final product.

###### Testing:
Combining automation and manual testing, the development team scrutinizes the software for defects. Quality analysis encompasses error detection and validation against customer requirements. Since many teams practice concurrent testing alongside development, the testing phase often runs parallel to the development phase.

###### Deployment:
Software development typically involves coding and testing on separate environments from those accessed by users. The environment where customers interact with the software is termed production, while development and testing environments are referred to as build environments. The deployment phase encompasses tasks like packaging, environment configuration, and installation, facilitating the transition of the latest build to the production environment.

###### Maintenance:
In the maintenance phase, the team attends to various responsibilities, including bug fixes, customer issue resolution, and software management. Additionally, they monitor system performance, security, and user experience, identifying opportunities for enhancing existing software.

##### SDLC Models
SDLC models offer structured frameworks for organizing the software development process. Each model arranges phases in different sequences to optimize development cycles.

**Waterfall Model:** Phases progress sequentially, with each phase dependent on the outcome of the previous one. Provides discipline to project management but offers little flexibility for changes once a phase is complete. Suited for small projects with well-defined requirements.  
**Iterative Model:** Development begins with a subset of requirements, and software versions are iteratively enhanced over time until completion. Allows for flexibility in managing changing requirements but may lead to scope changes and resource underestimation.  
**Spiral Model:** Combines small iterative cycles with linear sequential flow, prioritizing risk analysis. Suitable for large and complex projects that require frequent changes, but can be costly for smaller projects with limited scope.  
**Agile Model:** Phases are organized into rapid development cycles, delivering incremental changes in each cycle. Allows for quick response to change, continuous evaluation of requirements, and engagement with stakeholders. Rapid development cycles help identify and address issues early but overreliance on customer feedback could lead to excessive scope changes.

##### SDLC Security
In traditional software development, security testing was a separate process from the SDLC, resulting in undetected security flaws and heightened risks. However, modern practices integrate security seamlessly into the SDLC, following DevSecOps principles.

DevSecOps involves integrating security testing at every stage of the development process. It fosters collaboration between developers, security specialists, and operations teams to build software resilient to modern threats. Security assurance activities such as code review, architecture analysis, and penetration testing are incorporated throughout the development efforts.
