## MERN WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION IN AWS
The MERN stack, comprised of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, is a powerful JavaScript-based technology stack for building modern web applications. MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, offering flexibility and scalability for storing data in JSON-like documents. Express.js provides a robust web application framework for Node.js, simplifying server-side development with features like routing and middleware support. React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enables the creation of dynamic and interactive front-end experiences through its component-based architecture. Node.js, as the JavaScript runtime environment, executes server-side code and facilitates the development of scalable and high-performance web applications. Together, the MERN stack empowers developers to build feature-rich, real-time web applications efficiently, making it a popular choice across various industries and use cases.
